## Before You Start

We appreciate every developer who wants to contribute. To ensure the best experience for both contributors and maintainers:

- **Start with code, not meetings** - Submit at least one meaningful pull request before requesting deeper involvement
- **Find an issue** - Check our [issue tracker](https://github.com/lane711/sonicjs/issues) for something to work on

## What Counts as a Meaningful Contribution?
