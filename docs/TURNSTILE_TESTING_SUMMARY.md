## 📋 Test Configuration

### Prerequisites
- Playwright installed: `pnpm dlx playwright install`
- Dev server running: `pnpm run dev`
- Database migrated: `pnpm run db:migrate`
- Admin user exists (created automatically in tests)

### Test Environment
- **Browser**: Chromium (headless)
- **Base URL**: http://localhost:8787
- **Timeout**: 30 seconds per test
- **Retries**: 0 (fail fast for debugging)
- **Parallelization**: Serial mode for related tests

## 🐛 Known Test Limitations

### Cloudflare Turnstile in Localhost
The tests use Cloudflare's test keys which work in localhost:
- **Test Site Key**: `1x00000000000000000000AA`
- **Test Secret Key**: `1x0000000000000000000000000000000AA`

These keys always pass verification in test environments but may show console warnings. This is expected and normal.

### CI/CD Testing
In CI, tests will run against a real Cloudflare Workers preview environment with:
- Real D1 database
- Real Cloudflare infrastructure
- No localhost warnings
- Full Turnstile functionality
